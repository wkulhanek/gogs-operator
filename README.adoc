= Gogs Operator

== Overview

This repository contains the code to build a Gogs Operator for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. It will not run on Kubernetes because it uses the `Route` object to provide access to Gogs.

The Operator will create a *PostgreSQL* database with persistent storage and a *Gogs Server* also with persistent storage connected to the PostgreSQL database.

It is implemented on top of the Red Hat https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk[Operator SDK] - in particular the https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk/blob/master/doc/ansible/user-guide.md[Ansible Operator].

== Building the Operator Image

There is a script `build.sh` which will download the prerequisite Ansible roles from https://github.com/redhat-gpte-devopsautomation/ansible-operator-roles and install the required roles. The script will then build the container image.

Before running the script make sure to update the location of the container image to a repository you have access to. If you decide to build your own also make sure to update deploy/operator.yaml with the updated container image location.

== Installation

=== Common Installation Steps

The installation of the Custom Resource Definition and Cluster Role requires *cluster-admin* privileges. After that regular users with `admin` privileges on their projects (which is automatically granted to the user who creates a project) can provision the Gogs Operator in their projects and deploy instances of Gogs using the gogs.gpte.opentlc.com Custom Resource.

Perform the following tasks as *cluster-admin*:

. Deploy the Custom Resource Definition:
+
[source,sh]
----
oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wkulhanek/gogs-operator/master/deploy/crds/gpte_v1alpha1_gogs_crd.yaml
----

. Deploy the `gogs-admin-rules` Cluster Role (which will be granted automatically to everyone with `admin` privileges). This role allows every project admin to create Gogs custom resources:
+
[source,sh]
----
oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wkulhanek/gogs-operator/master/deploy/clusterrole_admin.yaml
----

=== Clusterwide Installation

Perform the following tasks as *cluster-admin*:

. Create the Cluster Role for the Operator
+
[source,sh]
----
oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wkulhanek/gogs-operator/master/deploy/cluster_role.yaml
----

. Create a project for the operator to run in (different from where the application will be running)
+
[source,sh]
----
oc new-project gpte-operators --display-name="GPTE Operators"
----

. Deploy the *gogs-operator* service account:
+
[source,sh]
----
oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wkulhanek/gogs-operator/master/deploy/service_account.yaml
----

. Grant the *gogs-cluster-operator* role to the *gogs-operator* service account (if your project is not `gpte-operators` change the project name in the command):
+
[source,sh]
----
oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user gogs-operator system:serviceaccount:gpte-operators:gogs-operator
----

. And finally create the Gogs *Operator*:
+
[source,sh]
----
oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wkulhanek/gogs-operator/master/deploy/operator.yaml
----

. Once the Operator pod is running the Operator is ready to start creating Gogs Servers.

=== Local Installation in a Project

The next steps work either as *cluster-admin* or as a *regular user*.

. Create a new project in which to deploy Gogs:
+
[source,sh]
----
oc new-project gogs --display-name "Gogs Server"
----

. Deploy the *gogs-operator* service account:
+
[source,sh]
----
oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wkulhanek/gogs-operator/master/deploy/service_account.yaml
----

. Deploy the *gogs-operator* role:
+
[source,sh]
----
oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wkulhanek/gogs-operator/master/deploy/role.yaml
----

. Grant the *gogs-operator* role to the *gogs-operator* service account:
+
[source,sh]
----
oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wkulhanek/gogs-operator/master/deploy/rolebinding.yaml
----

. And finally create the Gogs *Operator*:
+
[source,sh]
----
oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wkulhanek/gogs-operator/master/deploy/operator.yaml
----

. Once the Operator pod is running the Operator is ready to start creating Gogs Servers.

== Deploying a Gogs Server using the Operator

The Gogs Server is deployed by creating a Custom Resource based on the gogs Custom Resource Definition. There is an example of a Gogs CR at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wkulhanek/gogs-operator/master/deploy/crds/gpte_v1alpha1_gogs_cr.yaml.

The Gogs Operator understands the following settings under it's *spec* setting:

* postgresqlVolumeSize: The size of the Persistent Volume to be created for the PostgreSQL database (e.g. 4Gi)
* gogsVolumeSize: The size of the Persistent Volume to be created for the Gogs database (e.g. 4Gi)
* gogsSsl: Weather the created route should be a HTTP (false) or HTTPS (true) route.
* gogsServiceName: Optional. The name of the gogs service. The default is "gogs-metadata.name" where _metadata.name_ is the name of the CR object (in the example below `gogs-server`). When specifying this parameter ensure that the service name does not already exist in the project/namespace.

.Example
[source,texinfo]
----
apiVersion: gpte.opentlc.com/v1alpha1
kind: Gogs
metadata:
  name: gogs-server
spec:
  postgresqlVolumeSize: 4Gi
  gogsVolumeSize: 4Gi
  gogsSsl: True
  gogsServiceName: mygogs
----

. Write the definition to a file (e.g. gogs-server.yaml) and then create the Gogs instance:
+
[source,sh]
----
oc create -f ./gogs-server.yaml
----

. The operator will first create the PostgreSQL database, wait until it is up and running and then create the Gogs Server.
. Validate that both pods (postgresql and gogs) are running before proceeding.
. You can validate the existence of your Gogs Server by querying for gogs objects:
+
[source,sh]
----
oc get gogs
----

. Get the Route for the Gogs Server (the PostgreSQL database is not accessible outside of the project):
+
[source,sh]
----
oc get route
----

. Use the hostname returned in your Web Browser to open the Gogs UI.

== Deleting a Gogs Server

Deleting a gogs server and its associated resources is as simple as deleting the gogs object. If you created a gogs server called `gogs-server` as in the example above it suffices to run the delete command on that resource:

[source,sh]
----
oc delete gogs gogs-server
----

The Operator adds ownerReference fields to all created objects - which means that deleting the Gogs object also deletes all objects that have been created by the Operator.

== Uninstalling the Gogs Operator

In case you wish to uninstall the Gogs Operator make sure that there are no more Gogs instances running. Once all Gogs instances have been deleted simply delete the project the operator is running in.

[source,sh]
----
oc delete project gogs
----

Then as *cluster-admin* delete the ClusterRole and Custom Resource:

[source,sh]
----
oc delete clusterrole gogs-admin-rules
oc delete crd gogs.gogs.opentlc.com
----
